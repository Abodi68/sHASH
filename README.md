# sHASH.2

Hello! Welcome to my simple Hash tool or sHASH! 

This is my capstone Project for the summer of 2025. 

v0.4 - We have a complete rebuild! Rebranded as sHASH.2
Changes in this version. 
- Removed options for other algorithms
- Removed support for the MD5 algorithm, as its accuracy and overall security are lacking.
- Focusing on SHA2 algorithms, specifically SHA-256 and SHA-512. 
- Features threaded functions for optimization.
- Added output file that is updated for every hash with respective timestamps. 

This has been packaged as a .deb app. Still learning how this works! 

v0.3 goals
 - Utilize cli options such as -h for onboard help documentation
 - accurately hash a file and output the value to the interface.
 - utilize MD5 and, eventually, the SHA variants.
 - utilize proper error and file handling.
