# sHASH

Hello! Welcome to my simple Hash tool or sHASH! 

This is my capstone Project for the summer of 2025. 

Currently, I am only utilizing the MD5 Algorithm while I continue to learn about the Open SSL 3.0 Library and its usage for C++. 

Current Goals 
 - Utilize cli options such as -h for onboard help documentation
 - accurately hash a file and output the value to the interface.
 - utilize MD5 and, eventually, the SHA variants.
 - utilize proper error and file handling.
